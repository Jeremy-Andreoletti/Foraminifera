	abstract = {The fossil record of planktonic foraminifers is a key source of data on the biodiversity and evolution of marine plankton. One of the most distinctive foraminiferal taxa, Orbulina universa, widely used as a stratigraphic and paleoclimatic index, has always been regarded as a single species. Here we present a phylogenetic analysis of Orbulina small subunit rDNA sequences from 25 pelagic stations covering 100° latitude in the Atlantic Ocean. The genetic data reveal the presence of three cryptic species, whose distribution is clearly correlated to hydrographic provinces, and particularly to sea-surface total chlorophyll a concentration. Our results, together with previous studies, suggest that a considerable part of the diversity among planktonic foraminifers has been overlooked in morphological taxonomies. Our data also support the idea that planktonic foraminifers, even if adapted to particular hydrographic conditions, are high-dispersal organisms whose speciation may be similar to that of other high-dispersal taxa in which reproductive mechanisms and behavior, rather than just geographic barriers to dispersal, play key roles in species formation and maintenance.},

	abstract = {We present a complete phylogeny of macroperforate planktonic foraminifer species of the Cenozoic Era (∼65 million years ago to present). The phylogeny is developed from a large body of palaeontological work that details the evolutionary relationships and stratigraphic (time) distributions of species-level taxa identified from morphology (‘morphospecies’). Morphospecies are assigned to morphogroups and ecogroups depending on test morphology and inferred habitat, respectively. Because gradual evolution is well documented in this clade, we have identified many instances of morphospecies intergrading over time, allowing us to eliminate ‘pseudospeciation’ and ‘pseudoextinction’ from the record and thereby permit the construction of a more natural phylogeny based on inferred biological lineages. Each cladogenetic event is determined as either budding or bifurcating depending on the pattern of morphological change at the time of branching. This lineage phylogeny provides palaeontologically calibrated ages for each divergence that are entirely independent of molecular data. The tree provides a model system for macroevolutionary studies in the fossil record addressing questions of speciation, extinction, and rates and patterns of evolution.},

            Understanding what shapes species phenotypes over macroevolutionary timescales from comparative data often requires studying the relationship between phenotypes and putative explanatory factors or testing for differences in phenotypes across species groups. In phyllostomid bats for example, is mandible morphology associated to diet preferences? Performing such analyses depends upon reliable phylogenetic regression techniques and associated tests (e.g., phylogenetic Generalized Least Squares, pGLS, and phylogenetic analyses of variance and covariance, pANOVA, pANCOVA). While these tools are well established for univariate data, their multivariate counterparts are lagging behind. This is particularly true for high-dimensional phenotypic data, such as morphometric data. Here, we implement much-needed likelihood-based multivariate pGLS, pMANOVA, and pMANCOVA, and use a recently developed penalized-likelihood framework to extend their application to the difficult case when the number of traits \$p\$ approaches or exceeds the number of species \$n\$. We then focus on the pMANOVA and use intensive simulations to assess the performance of the approach as \$p\$ increases, under various levels of phylogenetic signal and correlations between the traits, phylogenetic structure in the predictors, and under various types of phenotypic differences across species groups. We show that our approach outperforms available alternatives under all circumstances, with greater power to detect phenotypic differences across species group when they exist, and a lower risk of improperly detecting nonexistent differences. Finally, we provide an empirical illustration of our pMANOVA on a geometric-morphometric data set describing mandible morphology in phyllostomid bats along with data on their diet preferences. Overall our results show significant differences between ecological groups. Our approach, implemented in the R package mvMORPH and illustrated in a tutorial for end-users, provides efficient multivariate phylogenetic regression tools for understanding what shapes phenotypic differences across species.
